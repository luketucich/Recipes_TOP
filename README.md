In this project, I will be utilizing my introductory HTML skills to craft a webpage for a food recipe. 

After the construction of this project, I will update this file with detailed information regarding what I used to make the web page, as well as what I learned!

I finished. I used headings, links, images, lists, etc. It was a simple project. I feel comfortable with the programming now and am excited to move onto CSS & JS.
Thank you!
